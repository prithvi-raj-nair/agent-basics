This is a straightforward billing inquiry that requires access to payment records, subscription details, and the ability to process refunds or corrections. While there may be a technical reason for the charge (such as an upgrade or add-on), the primary concern is financial and requires billing team expertise to investigate the charge and make any necessary adjustments.\n",

      "**Payment Options (if balance remains):**\n",
